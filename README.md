# multimodal_passive_bipedal_locomotion
Source code of the **"Multimodal Bipedal Locomotion Generation with Passive Dynamics via Deep Reinforcement Learning".**

This implementation uses Pytorch and it is based on the **SpinningUp** code (https://github.com/openai/spinningup). We customized the spinningUp codebase to run our experiments. Author of modification: Shunsuke Koseki e-mail:shunsuke.koseki.q4☆dc.tohoku.ac.jp (change ☆ to @)

When you use our framework, please note that to modify the definition of "reset" in mujoco_env.py in the gym library.
