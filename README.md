# multimodal_passive_bipedal_locomotion
Source code of the "Multimodal Bipedal Locomotion Generation with Passive Dynamics via Deep Reinforcement Learning".

I modified the spinning up code (https://github.com/openai/spinningup).

Note that "reset" in mujoco_env.py was a little modified.

This implementation uses Pytorch and it is based on the *SpinningUp code* (https://github.com/openai/spinningup). We customized the spinningUp codebase to run our experiments. Author of modification: Shunsuke Koseki e-mail:shunsuke.koseki.q4@dc.tohoku.ac.jp
